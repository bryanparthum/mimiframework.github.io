Mimi is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package for [integrated assessment models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling). 

The source code for this package is located on Github [here](https://github.com/mimiframework/Mimi.jl), and for detailed information on the installation and use of this package, as well as several tutorials, please see the [Documentation](https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/stable/). For specific requests for new functionality, or bug reports, please add an [Issue](https://github.com/mimiframework/Mimi.jl/issues) to the repository.

Support for users is primarily hosted on the [Mimi Framework forum](https://forum.mimiframework.org), where we also post PSA topics with recent software updates and important information for users. Please get in touch with [David Anthoff](http://www.david-anthoff.com) if you have further questions about using this framework or want to be involved in any way with this effort.

## News

The Mimi developement team recently participated in the 2019 Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (AERE) summer conference during the pre-conference workshop on Advances in Integrated Assessment Models. This included both a presentation and a hands-on session demonstrating various use cases for Mimi. The Github repository [here](https://github.com/davidanthoff/teaching-2019-aere-workshop) contains a) all slides from the workshop and b) all the code from the hands on sessions, which may be of interest to Mimi users. Importantly note that the linked code represents as a snapshot of Mimi at the time of the workshop, and **will not** be updated to reflect new changes.

## Mimi Registry

For convenience, several models are registered in the [MimiRegistry](https://github.com/mimiframework/Mimi.jl), and operate as packages with the Julia package manager [Pkg](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/index.html). For details on connecting to this central Mimi registry, see the Mimi [Documentation](https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/stable/).

The models currently included in the registry include those linked below.

* [MimiFUND.jl](https://github.com/fund-model/MimiFUND.jl)
* [MimiDICE2010.jl](https://github.com/anthofflab/MimiDICE2010.jl)
* [MimiDICE2013.jl](https://github.com/anthofflab/MimiDICE2013.jl)
