Mimi is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) package for [integrated assessment models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling). 

The source code for this package is located in on Github [here](https://github.com/mimiframework/Mimi.jl), and for detailed information on the installation and use of this package, as well as several tutorials, please see the [Documentation](https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/stable/). For specific requests for new functionality, or bug reports, please add an [Issue](https://github.com/mimiframework/Mimi.jl/issues) to the repository.

Support for users is primarily hosted on the [Mimi Framework forum](https://forum.mimiframework.org). Please get in touch with [David Anthoff](http://www.david-anthoff.com) if you have further questions about using this framework or want to be involved in any way with this effort.

## Mimi Registry

For convenience, several models are registered in the [MimiRegistry](https://github.com/mimiframework/Mimi.jl), and operate as packages with the Julia package manager [Pkg](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/index.html). For details on connecting to this central Mimi registry, see the Mimi [Documentation](https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/stable/).

The models currently included in the registry include those linked below.

* [MimiFUND.jl](https://github.com/fund-model/MimiFUND.jl)
* [MimiDICE2010.jl](https://github.com/anthofflab/MimiDICE2010.jl)
* [MimiDICE2013.jl](https://github.com/anthofflab/MimiDICE2013.jl)
* [MimiRICE2010.jl](https://github.com/anthofflab/MimiRICE2010.jl)
