# Documentation

**To get started with Mimi, head to the documentation [here](https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/stable/)!**  

*For the most up-to-date documentation that matches with the master branch of Mimi as opposed to the most recent tag, more advanced users may go [here](https://www.mimiframework.org/Mimi.jl/dev/) (or simply navigate to the "dev" option in the Version dropdown menu in the bottom-left hand corner of the documentation website), but unless required for your work using this branch and docs is **not recommended** as we cannot gaurantee stability of this branch at any given time.*
